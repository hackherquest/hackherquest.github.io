                The event will take place on Friday the 14th of February, on the campus of Radboud 
                University in Nijmegen. It is possible to sign up for only the workshops or only the
                CTF/Treasure Hunt. However, we give preference to women who will be participating 
                throughout the entire day. Because the event promotes women in Cyber Security, you 
                have to identify as a female student to participate in any of the events.
                <br><br>
                Lunch will also only be provided to participants who will be attending the entire day. 
                Please inform us of any dietary restrictions when you sign up through the Google form.
                
<!--                 We currently cannot garantee that there will be dinner in the evening.   -->
                <br><br>
                The groups are semi-random, which means that you can sign up for the Capture The Flag / Treasure Hunt
                competition either on our own or with a buddy. Both of you need to be female students
                in either high school or (applied) university. You then get assigned to a group of 4. 
                This is to make the groups more or less equal in experience level, and to allow you to
                get to know fellow Cyber Security enthousiasts.
                <br><br> 
                It is possible to sign up as a PhD student. However, preference is given to (applied) university studens.

                    The Capture The Flag (CTF) competition is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to find hidden 
                    flags. The challenges are based on real-world scenarios and are designed to test the participants' knowledge and skills 
                    in various cybersecurity domains. The competition is open to all skill levels, but the challenges will lean more towards
                    beginner and intermediate levels. The competition will be held on-site and will last for 3,5 hours. There will be prizes
                    for the winners.
                    <br><br>
