                The event will take place on Friday the 14th of February 2025, on the campus of Radboud 
                University in Nijmegen.

                        It is possible to sign up for only the workshops or only the
                        CTF/Treasure Hunt. However, we give preference to women who will be participating 
                        throughout the entire day.

                        Because the event promotes women in Cyber Security, you 
                        have to identify as a female student to participate in any of the events.

                        The groups are semi-random, which means that you can sign up for the Capture The Flag / Treasure Hunt
                        competition either on our own or with a buddy. Both of you need to be female students
                        in either high school or (applied) university. You then get assigned to a group of 3.

                    The Capture The Flag (CTF) competition is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to find hidden 
                    flags. The challenges are based on real-world scenarios and are designed to test the participants' knowledge and skills 
                    in various cybersecurity domains. The competition is open to all skill levels, but the challenges will lean more towards
                    beginner and intermediate levels. The competition will be held on-site and will last for 3,5 hours. There will be prizes
                    for the winners. University students who are doing a HBO- or WO study can apply for the CTF.
                    <br><br>
                    Students who sign up for the CTF, will have the opportunity to participate in one of the 2-hour workshops that will be
                    held in the morning. They can choose between the following workshops: Introduction to Hardware Hacking, Introduction to Cryptography, 
                    and Introduction to Z3 solving. The workshops are designed for beginners and are on-site. 
                    <br><br>
                    Complete beginners have the opportunity to join the Introduction to Web Security workshop, in which case they will join 
                    the High School students in the morning session.
