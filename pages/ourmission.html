            <p class="white-text" style="font-size: 20px; margin-right: 20px; font-weight:bold;">
                We are a team of 3 women who are passionate about technology and want to inspire
                fellow girls to pursue a career in Cyber Security. Our mission is to create a 
                safe space for women to become more knowledgeable in the field of Cyber Security.
                <br><br>
                We participated together in the Hack4Her 2024 competition at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU), and managed to secure the first place 
                in the DuckDB challenge. We were inspired by this event, but wanted to created a more Cyber Security focused competition.
                This is what lead us to create our own event: Hack{h}erQuest. A Capture The Flag (CTF) competition for women only.
